					<h1>Surviving the Software licenses</h1>
					<p><small>by Nikolay Kroshko</small></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Hello, everyone.<br>
						My name is Nick and with this video I'd like to present you my talk about software licenses.<br>
						I called it 'SURVIVING THE SOFTWARE LICENSES'
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Software types</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>proprietary</li>
						<li>free</li>
						<li>open source</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						I'd like to start with some general things about software.<br>
						In general software could be divided into 3 major groups.<br>
						It a proprietary, free and open source software.<br>
						<br>
						Proprietary software is about:<br>
						- exclusive ownership with a single company;<br>
						- protection of knowledge about the technology or the product<br>
						- creation of a closed infrastructure with other products of the same company<br>
						Also everything about proprietary software is protected with such legal instruments as the patents, trademarks and copyrights<br>
						<br>
						It's much easier with free software.<br>
						Free software is more about freedom in usage, modification, and redistribution.<br>
						It also could be used as part of another software package.<br>
						The only restriction about free software is that any redistributed version of the software must be distributed with the original terms of free use, modification, and distribution - so called copyleft<br>
						<br>
						And the final one, but the most interesting for us is open source software.<br>
						Open Source it is a certification mark owned by the Open Source Initiative(OSI).<br>
						In general, open source refers to any program which source code is made available for use or modification as users or other developers see fit.<br>
						In case if you are going to use the Open Source trademark - your distribution terms must feet to the OSI's Open Source Definition.<br> 
						In general this Definition model of distribution terms require that:<br>
						- One - The software being distributed must be redistributed to anyone else without any restriction.<br>
						- Two - The source code must be made available (so that the receiving party will be able to improve or modify it).<br>
						- Three - The license can require improved versions of the software to carry a different name or version from the original software.<br>
						<br>
						Now lets finally go to licenses.<br>
						In this talk I'll speak mostly about open source licenses.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>What is that?</h3>
					<ul>
						<p>A software license is a legal instrument governing the use or redistribution of software.</p>
						<p>Software license it is a document that provides legally binding guidelines for the use and distribution of software.</p>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Lets start from the definition.<br>
						According to wikipedia, software license it is a legal instrument governing the use or redistribution of software.<br>
						The other definition tells us that software license it is a document that provides legally binding guidelines for the use and distribution of software.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>What is it for?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>provide end users with the right to one or more copies of the software without violating 
							<a href='https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/copyright'>copyrights</a>
						</li>
						<li>defines the terms under which users may redistribute or copy the software for future development or use</li>
						<li>defines the responsibilities of the parties entering into the license agreement
						</li>
						<li>defines <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/fair-use">fair use</a> 
							of the software, the limitations of liability, warranties, disclaimers and protections if the software 
							or its use infringes on the 
							<a href='https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/intellectual-property-IP'>intellectual property</a> 
							rights of others</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						That all is very nice but doesn't tell us much.<br>
						So why do we might need licenses or what are they used for?<br>
						Well, there are a couple things:<br>
						One - to delegate to an end users some right to one or more copies of the software without violating copyrights<br>
						Two - to define terms of redistribution or copying the software for future development or usage<br>
						Three - to define responsibilities of the sides, who have signed the license agreement<br>
						Four - to define other limitations, warranties and disclaimers<br>
						Well, everything, to protect intellectual property

					<br><a href="https://github.blog/2015-03-09-open-source-license-usage-on-github-com/">Article</a>
					<aside class="notes">
						Lets continue with a little of charts and statistics.<br>
						This chart was taken from article, based on data from github.
						Unfortunately ir is a bit outdated. Article was written in 2015.<br>
						But still we can see dynamic of usage of open source licenses in github repos between 2008 and 2015.<br>
						Also we can notice that there were no revolutions and correlation between used licenses was approximately same during the all mentioned years

					<h3>Breakdown of license usage at 2015</h3>
					<img src="./img/Screenshot_3.jpg" alt="license statistics">
					<aside class="notes">
						This slide gives us a bit more numbers about the situation in 2015.<br>
						As we can see MIT, Apache, and GPL were the clear front runners at that moment.

					<br><a href="https://resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/blog-whitesource/top-open-source-licenses-trends-and-predictions">Next article</a>
					<aside class="notes">
						Here we can see some fresher statistics from another article.<br>
						It shows data between years 2012 and 2018<br>
						The WhiteSource database, which includes over 3M open source components and 70M files, covering over 200 programming languages was used as data source for it<br>
						Current chart shows correlation between permissive and copy-left open source licenses.<br>
						A permissive software license it's a license with minimal requirements about how the software can be redistributed.<br>
						As we can see permissive, or “Anything Goes” open source licenses were on the rise.<br>

					<h3>Top 10 Open Source Licenses in 2018</h3>
					<img src="./img/itemeditorimage_5c111e0327a89.png" alt="">
					<aside class="notes">
						On this slide we can see software licenses breakdown for 2018 from the WhiteSource database<br>
						And according to those we can see same top three licenses: MIT, Apache, and GPL, as from github data.<br>
						Let now get some details about few most popular licenses
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>MIT license</h3>
					<img src="./img/MIT.jpg" alt="">
					<aside class="notes">
						MIT license<br>
						It's a short, permissive software license. Basically, you can do whatever you want as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software/source. There are many variations of this license in use.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)</h3>
					<img src="./img/Apache2.jpg" alt="">
					<aside class="notes">
						Apache License 2.0<br>
						This license is a bit more strict then MIT license, but you still can do what you like with the software, as long as you include the required notices.<br>
						Accept you can not use the trademark of the software.
						Also this permissive license contains a patent license from the contributors of the code.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>GNU General Public License v3<br>(GPL-3)</h3>
					<img src="./img/GPL3.jpg" alt="">
					<aside class="notes">
						GPL3 license.<br>
						Under this license you may copy, distribute and modify the software as long as you track changes/dates in source files. Any modifications or software including to GPL-licensed code must also be made available under the GPL along with build & install instructions.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>GNU General Public License v2.0<br>(GPL-2.0)</h3>
					<img src="./img/GPL2.jpg" alt="">
					<aside class="notes">
						GPL2 license.<br>
						It's an older version of previous one. The new license version contains a series of clauses that address questions that were not or were only insufficiently covered in version 2 of the GPL.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>BSD 3-Clause License</h3>
					<img src="./img/BSD3.jpg" alt="">
					<aside class="notes">
						BSD 3-Clause License<br>
						This license allows unlimited redistribution for any purpose as long as its copyright notices and the license's disclaimers of warranty are maintained. The license also contains a clause restricting use of the names of contributors for endorsement of a derived work without specific permission.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL)</h3>
					<img src="./img/MsPL.jpg" alt="">
					<aside class="notes">
						Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL)<br>
						This is the least restrictive of the Microsoft licenses and allows for distribution of compiled code for either commercial or non-commercial purposes under any license that complies with the Ms-PL. Redistribution of the source code itself is permitted only under the Ms-PL.

						That is all from my side.<br>
						Thank you for your attention.<br>
						Good luck.
