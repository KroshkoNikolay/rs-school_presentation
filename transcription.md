### Slide 1

Hello, everyone.<br>
My name is Nick and with this video I'd like to present you my talk about software licenses.<br>
I called it 'SURVIVING THE SOFTWARE LICENSES'

### Slide 2

I'd like to start with some general things about software.<br>
In general software could be divided into 3 major groups.<br>
It a proprietary, free and open source software.<br>
<br>
Proprietary software is about:<br>
- exclusive ownership with a single company;<br>
- protection of knowledge about the technology or the product<br>
- creation of a closed infrastructure with other products of the same company<br>
Also everything about proprietary software is protected with such legal instruments as the patents, trademarks and copyrights<br>
<br>
It's much easier with free software.<br>
Free software is more about freedom in usage, modification, and redistribution.<br>
It also could be used as part of another software package.<br>
The only restriction about free software is that any redistributed version of the software must be distributed with the original terms of free use, modification, and distribution - so called copyleft<br>
<br>
And the final one, but the most interesting for us is open source software.<br>
Open Source it is a certification mark owned by the Open Source Initiative(OSI).<br>
In general, open source refers to any program which source code is made available for use or modification as users or other developers see fit.<br>
In case if you are going to use the Open Source trademark - your distribution terms must feet to the OSI's Open Source Definition.<br> 
In general this Definition model of distribution terms require that:<br>
- One - The software being distributed must be redistributed to anyone else without any restriction.<br>
- Two - The source code must be made available (so that the receiving party will be able to improve or modify it).<br>
- Three - The license can require improved versions of the software to carry a different name or version from the original software.<br>
<br>
Now lets finally go to licenses.<br>
In this talk I'll speak mostly about open source licenses.<br>

### Slide 3

Lets start from the definition.<br>
According to wikipedia, software license it is a legal instrument governing the use or redistribution of software.<br>
The other definition tells us that software license it is a document that provides legally binding guidelines for the use and distribution of software.

### Slide 4

That all is very nice but doesn't tell us much.<br>
So why do we might need licenses or what are they used for?<br>
Well, there are a couple things:<br>
One - to delegate to an end users some right to one or more copies of the software without violating copyrights<br>
Two - to define terms of redistribution or copying the software for future development or usage<br>
Three - to define responsibilities of the sides, who have signed the license agreement<br>
Four - to define other limitations, warranties and disclaimers<br>
Well, everything, to protect intellectual property

### Slide 5

Lets continue with a little of charts and statistics.<br>
This chart was taken from article, based on data from github.
Unfortunately ir is a bit outdated. Article was written in 2015.<br>
But still we can see dynamic of usage of open source licenses in github repos between 2008 and 2015.<br>
Also we can notice that there were no revolutions and correlation between used licenses was approximately same during the all mentioned years

### Slide 6

This slide gives us a bit more numbers about the situation in 2015.<br>
As we can see MIT, Apache, and GPL were the clear front runners at that moment. 

### Slide 7

Here we can see some fresher statistics from another article.<br>
It shows data between years 2012 and 2018<br>
The WhiteSource database, which includes over 3M open source components and 70M files, covering over 200 programming languages was used as data source for it<br>
Current chart shows correlation between permissive and copy-left open source licenses.<br>
A permissive software license it's a license with minimal requirements about how the software can be redistributed.<br>
As we can see permissive, or “Anything Goes” open source licenses were on the rise.<br>

### Slide 8

On this slide we can see software licenses breakdown for 2018 from the WhiteSource database<br>
And according to those we can see same top three licenses: MIT, Apache, and GPL, as from github data.<br>
Let now get some details about few most popular licenses

### Slide 9

MIT license<br>
It's a short, permissive software license. Basically, you can do whatever you want as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software/source. There are many variations of this license in use.

### Slide 10

Apache License 2.0<br>
This license is a bit more strict then MIT license, but you still can do what you like with the software, as long as you include the required notices.<br>
Accept you can not use the trademark of the software.
Also this permissive license contains a patent license from the contributors of the code.

### Slide 11

GPL3 license.<br>
Under this license you may copy, distribute and modify the software as long as you track changes/dates in source files. Any modifications or software including to GPL-licensed code must also be made available under the GPL along with build & install instructions.

### Slide 12

GPL2 license.<br>
It's an older version of previous one. The new license version contains a series of clauses that address questions that were not or were only insufficiently covered in version 2 of the GPL.

### Slide 13

BSD 3-Clause License<br>
This license allows unlimited redistribution for any purpose as long as its copyright notices and the license's disclaimers of warranty are maintained. The license also contains a clause restricting use of the names of contributors for endorsement of a derived work without specific permission.

### Slide 14

Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL)<br>
This is the least restrictive of the Microsoft licenses and allows for distribution of compiled code for either commercial or non-commercial purposes under any license that complies with the Ms-PL. Redistribution of the source code itself is permitted only under the Ms-PL.

### Slide 15

That is all from my side.<br>
Thank you for your attention.<br>
Good luck.
