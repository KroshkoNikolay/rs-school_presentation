### Slide 1

Hello, everyone.<br>
I'm Nick and with this video I'd like to present my talk about software licenses.<br>
I called it 'SURVIVING THE SOFTWARE LICENSES'

### Slide 2

Lets start from the definition.<br>
According to wikipedia, software license it is a legal instrument governing the use or redistribution of software.<br>
The other definition tells us that software license it is a document that provides legally binding guidelines for the use and distribution of software.

### Slide 3

That all is nice but doesn't tell us much.<br>
So why do we might need licenses?<br> 
What are they used for?<br>
One - to delegate to an end users some right to one or more copies of the software without violating copyrights<br>
Two - to define terms of redistribution or copying the software for future development or usage<br>
Three - to define responsibilities of the of the sides, who have signed the license agreement
Four - to define other limitations, warranties and disclaimers<br>
Well, everything, to protect intellectual property

### Slide 4

In general software could be divided into 3 major groups.<br>
It a proprietary, free and open source software.<br>

Proprietary software is about:
- exclusive ownership with a single company;
- protection of knowledge about the technology or the product
- creation of a closed infrastructure with other products of the sam company<br>
Also everything about proprietary software is protected with such legal devices as the patents, trademarks and copyrights<br>
So it's all about isolation, full control and limited functionality. If you need something, that is not there - you can do nothing, unless developers provided some system of extensions.

It's much easier  with free software.<br>
And, despite the name, it doesn't mean that it has to be distributed for free.<br>
Free software is more about freedom in usage, modification, and redistribution.<br>
It also could be used as part of another software package.<br>
The only restriction about free software is that any redistributed version of the software must be distributed with the original terms of free use, modification, and distribution - so called copyleft<br>

And the final one, but the most interesting for us, as for web developers - open source software.<br>
Open Source it is a certification mark owned by the Open Source Initiative.<br>
In general, open source refers to any program whose source code is made available for use or modification as users or other developers see fit. Open source software is usually developed as a public collaboration and made freely available.<br>
In case if you are going to use the Open Source trademark - your distribution terms must feet to the OSI's Open Source Definition.<br> 
In general the Definition model of distribution terms require that:
- One - The software being distributed must be redistributed to anyone else without any restriction.
- Two - The source code must be made available (so that the receiving party will be able to improve or modify it).
- Three - The license can require improved versions of the software to carry a different name or version from the original software.

### Slide 5

Lets have a little of statistics.<br>
Data for this slide was taken from article, based on data from github.
Unfortunately statistics is a bit outdated. Article was written in 2015.<br>
This slide shows dynamic of usage of open source licenses in github repos.<br>

### Slide 6

This slide gets a bit more numbers.<br>
As we can see MIT, Apache, and GPL were the clear front runners at that moment, with some 15% of non-standard licenses or standard licenses that were not among those listed on github side project choosealicense.com. 

### Slide 7

Here we can see some fresher statistics from another article.<br>
It shows data between years 2012 and 2018<br>
This articles have used data from the WhiteSource database, which includes over 3M open source components and 70M files, covering over 200 programming languages<br>
Current chart shows correlation between permissive and copy-left open source licenses.<br>
A permissive software license it's a free-software license with minimal requirements about how the software can be redistributed.<br>
As we can see permissive, or “Anything Goes” open source licenses were on the rise. MIT and Apache licenses took first and second places.<br>

### Slide 8

On this slide we can see software licenses breakdown for 2018 from the WhiteSource database<br>
And according to those we can see same top three MIT, Apache, and GPL.
